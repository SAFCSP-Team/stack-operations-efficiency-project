# Stack Operations Efficiency

### Objective
This project aims to test your knowledge of time complexity and space complexity.

### Problem
Implement a stack data structure with efficient time and space complexity.

### Implementation

Implement a stack of characters that supports the following operations:
- push(item): Add an item to the top of the stack.
- pop(): Remove and return the item at the top of the stack.
- peek(): Return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
- isEmpty(): Check if the stack is empty.
- isFull(): Check if the stack is full (if there is a maximum capacity).

Ensure that all operations have a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(n).


### Qualification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] Write all the required functions correctly.
 - [ ] Completely define the stack class.
 - [ ] All operations have a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(n).
 - [ ] Submit your project by making a pull request on GitHub and sending the source code via email.
